React. Make component MarkdownEditor.jsx

Implement the <MarkdownEditor /> component, which is a React wrapper of the @toast-ui/editor plugin.
This plugin allows you to embed a Markdown editor into your page.
The component takes as input a function as the onContentChange property, which is called each time
it changes in the editor. The function takes in the contents of the editor.
